					<P ALIGN="left">After moving (in 2008), my first serious project has been a full featured, 
					all band HF Transceiver.&nbsp; I began with a fairly conventional design of the 
					analog circuitry: a SA612 (replaced the NE602) first mixer, MC1350 IF amp, and 
					an SA612 BFO mixer.&nbsp; I Initially designed a 2N5109 RF amplifier.&nbsp; This 
					classic design has excellent IP-3 and good gain, but in this case the power 
					consumption and noise figure caused me to replace it with a more modern OP-AMP 
					based design.&nbsp; I used a Linear Technology video amplifier instead with 
					excellent results.&nbsp; The IF is 45 MHz- dictated by the availability of nice 
					monolithic crystal filters from ECS (via Digikey).&nbsp; The fixed BFO is a 
					classic low noise Colpitts design with a varacter that allows for fine 
					adjustment.&nbsp; The VFO is an Analog Devices 9852 DDS.&nbsp; the whole thing 
					is controlled by a fairly high end PIC microcontroller, which allowed me to 
					write the software in C, and still have a full suite of features including a 
					keyer.&nbsp; A late addition was a switched capacitor filter in the audio path - 
					this has its clock supplied by one of the PIC's PWM outputs so its corner 
					frequency can be varied in software.&nbsp; The current version uses 800 Hz for 
					CW operation and 2.85KHz for SSB.&nbsp; The RF power amplifier is a salvaged 
					unit I got from eBay - it is capable of 100+W on all bands.&nbsp; The 
					transceiver is not restricted in software to transmit only in the ham bands so 
					some care is required when operating it.&nbsp; I had my first on air contact 
					with AA8R in Michigan on November 30 using PSK-31 on 20m at 10 Watts, got a 599 
					signal report. I monitored the transmitted audio locally with my K2 with no 
					antenna connected just from leakage - it sounded fine.&nbsp; I am still working 
					on the software, in particular it needs better filtering of the inputs from the 
					main tuning shaft encoder - its quite jumpy.&nbsp; It has a round off error when 
					computing the tuning word for the DDS which results in a frequency error of up 
					to 725 Hz in some places, I'm sure I can think of other things to improve as 
					well.&nbsp; Here are some pictures.</P>

					<p align="left">Here are the detailed schematic of the main board as a pdf
					<a href="AmateurRadio/analog.pdf">analog.pdf</a>&nbsp; and a zip <a href="AmateurRadio/Analog_radio.zip">
					Analog_radio.zip</a> of the source code for the processor.&nbsp; Since all the 
					routines are in C they are pretty readable and might be useful for someone else.&nbsp; 
					If you look closely at the analog section you'll see that its a direct ripoff of 
					the design in the recent QST by KD1JV.&nbsp; Since he did such a nice job I 
					reused it rather than roll yet another variant of the same basic circuit.&nbsp; 
					Though, there are many changes to his basic design such as the use of an Analog 
					Devices video switch to steer the oscillators, the rf amplifiers, (pre and post) 
					and some others. </p>
