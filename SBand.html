				<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>

				<P ALIGN="left">After building the new synthesizer (below) I decided that it was
				foolish to mate it with surplus 1970's vintage technology for the receiver so I
				designed a new receiver converter with modern components as well.&nbsp; Here are
				a couple of photos of the receiver in its shield enclosure (a recycled FO video
				modulator housing) and the whole receiver mated to its enclosure base.</P>

				<P ALIGN="left">And here are a couple of photos of the input filter as it was
				being assembled.&nbsp; A very conventional cavity filter which has an insertion
				loss at 2401 MHz of 0.5 dB and a 3dB bandwidth of about 15 MHz.&nbsp; Wide enough
				for use at 2396 but narrow enough to provide some real attenuation at the 2450
				MHz used by wireless networking gear and microwave ovens.&nbsp; About $2 worth
				of standard copper plumbing fittings, a few square inches of copper sheet, 2 SMA
				connectors (by far the most expensive parts!) and some solder.</P>

				<P ALIGN="left">Finally here is a picture of the schematic for the front end.&nbsp;
				The receiver employs an RF Microdevices GaAs LNA specifically
				designed for S-band operation (1.75 db specified NF).&nbsp; I could have gotten
				a lower noise figure with a discrete solution, but that would have required much
				more work so I took the easy way out and used the MMIC.&nbsp; Next is a New
				Japan Radio Corp.&nbsp; GaAs mixer designed for 1900 MHz PCS cellular service,
				but perfectly workable up through S-band.&nbsp; The mixer boasts nearly 7dB of
				conversion GAIN - quite a change from the usual case.&nbsp; Both these parts
				were obtained from suppliers selling small lots on e-Bay, though they can be
				found elsewhere.&nbsp; In this case I paid less than $2 for both, though I had
				to buy 100 mixers ($20) and 25 amplifiers ($25).&nbsp; The receiver also uses a
				very low noise linear 3V regulator from Microchip (whose input is picked off the +5v in the
				synthesizer) and a couple of Toko helical filters and a common mini circuits
				Gali series amplifier for the IF.&nbsp; (The prototype ended up with only the input
				filter installed, but it works fine).&nbsp; You can see in the fully
				assembled photo above, that I had to move the 5 volt regulator off the
				synthesizer board to the base plate to proved some heat sinking now that the
				whole front end is powered from it - it got quite hot when free standing with no
				heat sink!</P>

				<P ALIGN="left"><img border="0" src="images/rxCvrtr.jpg" width="890" ></P>

				<P ALIGN="left">Here are a couple of photos of the PCB pattern, the first of of
				the traces, and the second is of the component silk screen.&nbsp; These are NOT
				to scale. at the bottom is a .pdf of the trace pattern I used.&nbsp; This is
				designed for 0.010&quot; Rogers RT-Duroid.&nbsp; This can be obtained on line in
				7&quot;x10&quot; sheets (010 thick) from surplus sales (<a href="http://www.surplussales.com">http://www.surplussales.com</a>).&nbsp;
				The trace widths for all the 50 Ohm transmission lines are 0.016&quot; for this
				material.&nbsp; It is very low loss, and the small traces make it a reasonable
				match to the small parts.&nbsp; You could use .031&quot; thick FR-4, but the
				transmission lines are then 0.050&quot; wide - its still possible to get
				reasonable transitions down to the component pads without huge
				discontinuities.&nbsp; You probably cannot use the common 0.062&quot; thick FR-4
				since the transmission lines are then 0.1&quot; wide and nearly impossible to
				smoothly transition to the parts.&nbsp; My first prototype used this material
				and had significant stability problems, and a much higher noise figure than the
				final circuit.&nbsp; If you use this pattern I have provided it is possible to
				simply laser print it onto glossy photo paper (get the kind WITHOUT a plastic
				back) and iron it onto the RT-Duroid directly.&nbsp; Then just soak the whole
				thing in warm water and gently rub the paper off.&nbsp; Works like a charm!</P>

				<P ALIGN="left">And finally here is a .pdf of the trace pattern which should be
				exactly to scale.&nbsp; The only potential area of difficulty is the ground
				trace under the mixer, you may have to use an Exacto knife and scrape away the
				edges under the mixer to provide more clearance for the pins, especially if you
				are soldering by hand.&nbsp; Don't worry about detaching pin&nbsp; 5 from the
				central ground strip.&nbsp; It is also vital to small drill holes beside each of
				the strip lines (2 or three on each side), at the point where U1-Pin2 meets the
				larger plane, and the same for pin 5 of U2, and surrounding the filter, as well
				as the center pin of U4.&nbsp; These should have very small (30 Gauge) wires
				inserted and soldered to the ground plane on the bottom.&nbsp; More through
				holes are better so drill as many as you can stand.&nbsp; You also have to add a
				small jumper underneath to connect the trace feeding power to U1 to the +3V
				trace feeding U2.</P>

				<P ALIGN="left">The S-band receive converter (below) revision 1, proved
				unsatisfactory in actual use.&nbsp; Although it worked fairly well on the bench
				it suffered from intolerable microphonics on the mast.&nbsp; These are caused
				(primarily) by the LO design.&nbsp; Its high multiplication factors make it just
				too sensitive to parasitics, its very noisy, and its output power changes over 6
				dB with small changes in the dimension of the shields.&nbsp; So a new LO design
				was needed.&nbsp; Although the KE5FX hybrid synthesizer could serve here, its
				really overkill so I set out to design a simplified version more appropriate to
				use as a fixed service L.O.&nbsp; Below is a small image of the schematic, and a
				photo of the circuit board.</P>

				<p ALIGN="left">A pdf of the schematic is under the link above for those who are
				interested.&nbsp; This synthesizer is simply an Analog Devices ADF4112
				synthesizer, a Mini Circuits VCO and a PIC 16F57 together with the necessary
				power supply circuits to make it all work from 12 volts (nominal) input.&nbsp;
				It can produce any number (up to several hundred) of switch selectable output
				frequencies between 1 and 2 GHz, mine is programmed to produce either 1966 MHz
				or 1152 MHz depending on the status of the push button attached to RA1 at power
				up (or reset).&nbsp; As you can see from the photo the first spin of the circuit
				boards contained a couple of small errors, easily fixed with wire-overs. The
				connector visible at the bottom of the photo is used to program the PIC and is
				compatible with the inexpensive PICKit2 programmer (&lt; $100) as well as a
				variety of more expensive devices.&nbsp;I brought all the unused pins of the PIC
				(most of them!) to pads to allow for easy future expansion.&nbsp; These could be
				used for relays, a serial interface, or anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are links to the MPLab project
				files and assembly code for programming the synthesizer, as well as the Gerber
				(RS-274) files for the circuit board.&nbsp; I was able to get 10 manufactured
				(by PCB Express) for $279.&nbsp; The parts are a little less than $100.&nbsp;
				Pretty cheap for an accurate, low noise microwave synthesizer!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Switching power supply for KE5FX synthesizer</h1>

				<P ALIGN="left">I recently built a couple of KE5FX synthesizers as described in
				QEX in the March/April 2004 edition.&nbsp; (<a href="http://www.qsl.net/ke5fx/synth.html">http://www.qsl.net/ke5fx/synth.html</a>)&nbsp;
				On the whole, a very nice synthesizer and performance as advertised was fairly
				easy to get.&nbsp; The biggest drawback to this design is the complex power
				supply it requires 15 V in 2 places and 20 V for the VCO.&nbsp; For the
				projects&nbsp; I have in mind these are inconvenient so I set out to build a nice
				quiet switcher to power the synthesizer.&nbsp; Below is the result including
				a&nbsp; .zip file with Gerber suitable to have the board manufactured by&nbsp;
				PCB Express (<a href="http://www.pcbexpress.com">http://www.pcbexpress.com</a>)
				- they will make 2 blank boards for about $90, parts for the supply can all be
				had from Digikey for another $75 or so.</P>

				<P ALIGN="left" style="line-height: 150%">I have been building a satellite station recently and wanted a
				receive converter to convert from S-band (2401 MHz) to UHF.&nbsp; The FM
				satellites frequently operate in either V/U or L/S modes and so its convenient
				to have the receive converter work to UHF so that a minimum amount of error
				prone reconfiguration of transceivers is necessary to change modes.&nbsp; Since
				DEMI doesn't seem to have such a beast I decided to roll my own.&nbsp;
				Fortunately I had an old S band television block converter to start from - these
				are fairly common in rural areas and mostly pre-date direct TV satellites.&nbsp;
				Thy can usually be had cheap or free.&nbsp; Unfortunately, very little but the
				mixer is reusable.&nbsp; The LO in these things, although tunable over a wide
				range, is horribly unstable and could only be used as part of P.L.L. or synthesizer.&nbsp;
				That being the case I cast around for a nice simple way to build an L.O. - and I
				found one.&nbsp; Although this design could certainly be improved, in particular
				the final multiplication should be done in 2 or more steps (e.g. X5, x2) to
				reduce spurious output, this will work adequately for satellite work - probably
				not so good for moon bounce or other weak signal modes though!&nbsp; Here is the
				schematic (and a .pdf so you can save it and zoom to see detail).</P>

				temperature on the crystal.&nbsp; Basically a crude constant power oven.&nbsp;
				Finally, below is a photo with the vertical shields in place, and the L.O.
				mounted above the mixer.&nbsp; The small strip of brass running down and over
				the diode multiplier provides an additional parasitic element which peaks the
				multiplier and provides a few extra dB of output.&nbsp; The heater resistor is
				visible above the crystal oscillator module. This was before the 8 volt
				regulator was added to the MMIC amplifier supply line - necessary to prevent
				overheating when the box is closed.</P>
