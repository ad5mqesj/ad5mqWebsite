					  It has a measured gain of 19.8 dB at 435 MHz, and a noise figure of about 0.9 dB at the same frequency.  Most of the 
					  parts are common discretes (Including the Toko helical filter) available from Digikey or many other suppliers, the MMIC

					  <tr><td><p>Here is a <a href="AmateurRadio/TopLayer.pdf.zip">pdf</a>  that contains the top side pattern - mirrored for direct impression on a copper clad board.  The
					  RF traces are .050 wide providing 50 ohm impedance on a 0.31 thick FR-4 double sided board.  The top ground area and bottom
					  groud plane should be connected in many places,  I used lots of small pieces of solder wick around the edges.  There are a 
					  few through holes needed to ground various things to the bottom plane, I also placed three through wires directly under the 
					  helical filter to improve its grounding and therefore filtering characteristics.</p></td></tr>
