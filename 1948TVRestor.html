						I Recently decided I wanted to undertake the restoration of an antique television, the older the better.
						So I wouldn't be stuck with something too big to display or move around easily, I determined I should get
						 something small, a 1940's 7" model ideally.finally found one that looked promising on eBay	which sold 
						 for a reasonable amount so I bought it. Below are some photos before the restoration. I did disassembly, 
						 basic cleaning and tested all the tubes. Two of the CRT pins stayed in the socket when I removed it.
						 On inspection the wires emerging from the envelop were intact, the old solder joint had simply failed.
						Several more of the CRT Pins were loose. I removed the two errant pins from the socket, cleaned out the old 
						solder and reattached them to the CRT wires. I then added a	drop of super glue at the base of each pin, and 
						carefully cleaned the socket - which shows some evidence of old arcing. On inspection of the chassis it 
						is apparent that this set was repaired, probably in the 1960's. A couple of the paper capacitors were 
						replaced as well as 2 resistors in the horizontal output section. It also appears that all 3 large filter 
						capacitors and the ballast "tube" were replaced.  Because these filters would still be 30 or more years 
						old I have decided to bypass them under chassis in the usual fashion with new capacitors, as well as
						replace all the old paper capacitors - many of which show evidence of melting wax drips. All this will be 
						done before first power up.</font></p>

						You can clearly see the drips from the high voltage capacitors at the top in the horizontal output section. 
						You can also see the "new" black beauty under the large capacitor at top. You can also see a replacement cap
						nearer the bottom.  Although its not visible here, one of the wires on a filter	section is attached well 
						mechanically but not soldered, hence my conclusion it was replaced. Several solder joints at top look very 
						bad and are obviously cold. You can see at bottom I have removed the bolts from the selenium rectifiers and 
						mounted a pair of barrier strips to hold the new filter caps and diodes.</font></p>

						The case has seen better days, but is intact, including the back cover. It should be possible to replace the top 
						veneer and refinish the front.  The CRT gasket was melted at the top as you can see. Quite a bit of careful 
						scraping was needed to detach it from the CRT.</font></p>

						To get to this point some repairs were required in addition to the initial replacement of all the paper/wax caps.The video detector 
						used an early 1N34 - which was open, surprisingly, at least to me, the precision NPO caps in the detector were also open.
						Several of the plastic encapsulated mica caps in the vertical oscillator/amplifier were shorted.  Several high value 
						resistors in the same circuit were open. Part of this may have been because the replaced .05/6KV black beauty capacitor 
						from the earlier repair was shorted. Since the deflection plates are floating near the full 2nd anode potential (about 5 KV) 
						this caused some serious arcing, and surely accounts for at least a couple of the failures. However, resistors and 
						capacitors far away from the output tube, in the oscillator were also bad.	Looking at the distortion in the test pattern 
						I would say several resistors, and possibly caps which have not been replaced have changed value significantly.  The front 
						end RF and IF components appear to be ok. This picture (and sound) are produced via an RF signal at the input.Here is a schematic of 
						a similar - though not quite identical chassis. It took some looking to find this on a German website of a restorer of old TV's 
						over there. It is embedded at full size, but displayed smaller.</font></p>

						Finally finished today. Had to replace several tubes, and more resistors before it was all done.  Below are the photos 
						of the final chassis bottom, the assembled and fully refinished case</p></font>

						On the whole its working well. I have ordered replacements for 2 more of the tubes which show marginal emissions on my tube tester,
						but the television works and survived a several hour burn in.  Here finally, is a photo of the picture as seen through the original 
						water filled lens accessory and a photo of the set with the lens positioned for viewing.  The picture looks much 	better than the 
						photo would lead you to believe - it is quite difficult to photograph a live, moving picture on a television of this vintage.
						In person the picture is quite good for an analog, vacuum tube based television of any age. Now I only need to find gold colored transfer 
						letters to restore the labels on the front panel controls.</font></p>
