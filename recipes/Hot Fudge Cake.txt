Hot Fudge Cake

1 ¾ cups packed brown sugar, divided
1 cup flour
6 tablespoons cocoa, divided
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ cup 2% milk
2 tablespoons butter, melted
½ teaspoon vanilla
1 ½ cups semi sweet chocolate chips
1 ¾ cups boiling water
Vanilla ice cream

In a small bowl, combine 1 cup brown sugar, flour, 3 tablespoons cocoa, baking powder and salt. In another bowl, combine the milk, butter and vanilla; stir into dry ingredients just until combined. Spread evenly into a 3-quart slow cooker coated with cooking spray. Sprinkle with chocolate chips. In another small bowl, combine the remaining brown sugar and cocoa; stir in boiling water. Pour over batter (do not stir). Cover and cook on high for 4 – 4 ½ hours or until a toothpick inserted near the center of the cake comes out clean. Serve warm with ice cream.
