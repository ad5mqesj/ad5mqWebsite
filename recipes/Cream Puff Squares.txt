Cream Puff Squares
Debbie Clemente, 2003

Crust

3/4 cup water
6 tablespoons margarine
3/4 cup flour
3 eggs

Filling & Topping

2 cups cold milk
2 3.4 oz packages vanilla instant pudding and pie filling
1 8 oz container Cool Whip
2 squares semisweet chocolate, chopped

Preheat oven to 400°. For crust, heat water and butter in small saucepan over medium-high heat until butter is melted and mixture comes to a boil. Stir in flour all at once. Reduce heat to low and stir mixture vigorously about 1 minute or until mixture leaves sides of pan and forms a ball. Remove pan from heat; let stand 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition until mixture is smooth. Spread mixture evenly over bottom of 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake 20 minutes. (Surface will puff unevenly.) Prick 
10 - 12 times to release steam; continue baking 5 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Cool completely. For filling, pour milk into bowl. Add pudding mixes; whisk 2 minutes until thickened. Fold in 2 cups of Cool Whip. Spread mixture evenly over cooled crust. Refrigerate 1 hour. For topping, place chocolate and remaining Cool Whip in microwave-safe bowl. Microwave, uncovered, on high 30 - 40 seconds; stir until smooth. Pour chocolate mixture into small, resealable plastic bag. Close bag. Cut off the very tip of one corner of the plastic bag. Garnish each serving with a drizzle of chocolate. Refrigerate until ready to serve or serve immediately.
