Cinnamon Crispas

2 cups oil
flour tortillas
1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Put oil in a heavy, flat bottom skillet and heat over medium heat. Cut tortillas on cutting board with pizza cutter into 6 or 8 pie shaped pieces. Test oil to see if it's ready. Then using tongs, gently put pie shaped tortilla pieces into hot oil one at a time. Cook about 1 minute on each side letting them become a light golden color. Remove each piece from hot oil using tongs. Place cooked crispas on a plate that has layered paper towels on it. Into a double sacked brown paper bag, put sugar and cinnamon. Shake bag to mix cinnamon and sugar. Gently drop 2 or 3 crispas into bag and shake gently. Remove crispas from bag and place on plate.
