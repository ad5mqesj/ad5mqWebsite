Potato Salad

2 1/2 - 3 lbs potatoes (5 large or 8 - 9 medium)
8 hard-boiled eggs, peeled
1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup)
3 dill pickle spears, chopped (about 2/3 cup)
1 cup mayonnaise 
3 tablespoons liquid from dill pickle jar
2 tablespoons mustard
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper

Scrub potatoes well, but do not peel. Place potatoes in a stockpot, add water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium high and cook 12 - 15 minutes, or until a knife can easily pierce the potatoes, but they're still firm. Pour off the hot water, and add cold water to the pot to help cool down the potatoes. Set potatoes aside while preparing remaining ingredients. Roughly chop
the eggs. Add the chopped egg to a large mixing bowl. Add the onion and chopped pickles to the bowl. In a small mixing bowl, using a whisk, combine the mayonnaise, dill pickle liquid, mustard, salt and pepper. Whisk well to combine; set aside. Remove the cooled potatoes from the pot of water. With a paring knife, remove the potato peels (they will come off easily). Cut the potatoes into small cubes and add to the other ingredients in the mixing bowl. Gently toss the salad ingredients to mix. Add the dressing mixture and gently toss again to coat all ingredients well. Cover and refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving (preferably overnight) to let the flavors combine.
