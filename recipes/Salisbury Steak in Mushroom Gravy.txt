Salisbury Steak in Mushroom Gravy

2 lbs ground beef
1 package dry onion mushroom soup mix
1/4 cup ketchup
1 egg
2 cloves chopped garlic
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms
1 small onion, chopped
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups water
2 cans Cream of Mushroom soup
1 package brown gravy mix

In a large bowl, mix together beef, soup mix, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, egg, and garlic. Using your hands, shape beef mixture into 8 patties. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown meat patties on both sides. Place the browned patties into the slow cooker on low (overlapping is ok). In the same skillet, sauté mushrooms and onions until onions are translucent. Add cream of mushroom
soup, water and gravy mix and stir until well mixed. Pour over meat patties in crock pot and cook on low for 4 - 6 hours or until beef is done.
