Southern Bacon-Fried Cabbage

12 slices bacon, chopped
1 cup onion, chopped
1 large head cabbage, cored and chopped
2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/8 teaspoon garlic powder

Cook bacon in a jumbo cooker over medium-high heat until crisp. 
Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. 
Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease and discard the rest. 
In the same jumbo cooker, return the 2 tablespoons bacon grease. 
Over medium-high heat, cook the onion until it is soft, about 4 minutes. 
Stir in the cabbage and continue to cook and stir for 4 - 5 minutes. 
Add the seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder. Mix well. 
Reduce heat to low, cover and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. 
Just before serving, mix the bacon into the cooked cabbage.
